## Scripts

The following scripts have been configured in this project to facilitate development, deployment, and preview:

```
yarn dev
```

Starts the development environment. This command launches a local server and allows real-time changes during development. It's useful for rapid iteration and code testing in a local development environment.

```
yarn server
```

Starts the server in a production environment. When the project is ready for deployment on a live server, this command starts the server in a stable and optimized production environment.

```
yarn build
```

Compiles and builds the project. During the development process, source files (such as JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) often need to be transformed or packaged before deploying the project in a production environment.

```
yarn preview
```

Allows previewing a compiled version of the project before final deployment. After running yarn build, a folder or directory with the final project files is generated.
